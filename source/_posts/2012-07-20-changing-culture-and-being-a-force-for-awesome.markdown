### Cookbook News<a name="cookbooks"></a>
-------------
We just recorded [episode 21](http://foodfightshow.org/2012/07/monitoring-for-n00bs-with-jason-dixon.html) a couple of days ago so there aren't any new or updated cookbooks to cover today.  Since we don't have cookbook news, let's look at two knife plugins that help with your development workflow.

* [knife-essentials](https://github.com/jkeiser/knife-essentials) provides a number of useful knife commands that allow you to manipulate Chef using a common set of verbs that work on everything that is stored in the Chef server.
  * knife diff - Diffs objects on the server against files in the local repository. Output is similar to git diff.

* [knife-spork](https://github.com/jonlives/knife-spork) - is a workflow plugin for Chef::Knife which helps multiple devs work on the same chef server and repo without treading on eachothers toes. This plugin was designed around the workflow used at Etsy, where several people are working on the chef repo and chef server at the same time.
  * [Episode 11: Etsy Examined - How the Best Do Their Business](http://foodfightshow.org/2012/05/episode-11-etsy-examined-how-best-do.html)
  * Jon Cowie's presentation at Velocity 2012, [Michelin Starred Cooking with Chef](http://www.slideshare.net/jonlives/michelin-starred-cooking-with-chef)
  * Lessons from Etsy: Avoiding Kitchen Nightmares [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/mcdonnps/lessons-from-etsy-avoiding-kitchen-nightmares-chefconf-2012), [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSnJCJiZDDU)
