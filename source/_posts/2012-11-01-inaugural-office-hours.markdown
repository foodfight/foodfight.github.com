### Format

This Hangout will have an "Office Hours" format.  We are hoping for three types of participants:

1.  You have a question about Chef that you'd like some help with
2.  You have experience with Chef and would like to help answer a question
3.  You're interested in learning about what others are doing with Chef

If you have a question, please send it to [info@foodfightshow.org](mailto:info@foodfightshow.org) in advance or simply show up at the hangout.  Sharing some of your code would be great, as well.

This is an experiment and we hope to have similar hangouts in the future.

Questions, ideas, or feedback should be sent to [info@foodfightshow.org](mailto:info@foodfightshow.org).
