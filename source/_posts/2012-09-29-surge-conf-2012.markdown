Nathen spent part of this week at [Surge Conference](http://omniti.com/surge/2012) and was able to grab a bunch of the presenters for some quick interviews.  We also had a chance to sit down with [Michael Bevilacqua-Linn](http://twitter.com/novustiro) earlier in the week to discuss his presentation.
