* [Beyond Blame: Learning From Failure and Success by Dave Zwieback](http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Blame-Learning-Failure-Success/dp/1491906413/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1446471230&sr=8-1&keywords=Dave+Zwieback)
* Learning Reviews vs Performance Reviews and Postmortems
* Blameless Postmortems
* The History of the Book and The Postmortems Workshops
* Lola's Postmortem Workshop Experience
* Identifying and Preventing Blame
* Accountability
* Prioritization
* Tradeoffs
* Understanding Risk
* Discount Rank (Why is an executive in the room?)
* Where do you start?
* Closing Comments
  * Postmortems reveal a lot of opportunities for organizational change. There is ideally a channel for directing this to the right team. (And someone empowered/able to manage that process)
  * Maybe you'd have an executives-only learning review about, say, a recent board meeting
  * Assess the degree of organizational maturity when figuring out how to set up learning reviews for success.
