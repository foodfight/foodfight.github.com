* Berkshelf 0.6.0beta1 is out, includes windows support and easier
  install. How much easier? It now uses a pure ruby constraint
  solver, which spares us the pain of having to hand-compile the
  gecode library. 0.6.0 builds on the [0.5.0 release](http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2012-09/msg00258.html) which had a ton of
  new features such as
  * now uses a built-in vagrant plugin instead of shims
  * Cookbooks and their dependencies will now automatically be provided to Vagrant when you boot your virtual machine.
  * Vagrant will receive any changes made to cookbooks on any future
    provision command.
  * can use the your Chef API as a soruce location
  * Cookbook generator
  * and others!

* [Karel Minarik](http://www.karmi.cz) and Vojtech Hyza gave a
["hello cloud" presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/karmi/shells-kitchen-infrastructure-as-code-webexpo-2012)
where they demonstrated how to spin up an application cluster that
includes a load balancer, 3 application servers, 1 database node, and
2 elasticsearch nodes. The recipes are on
[github](https://github.com/karmi/chef-hello-cloud/) for your browsing pleasure

* Cloudant labs posted
  [their analyis](https://cloudant.com/blog/cloudant-labs-on-google-spanner/)
  of Google's globally distributed datastore known as
  [Spanner](https://cloudant.com/blog/cloudant-labs-on-google-spanner/).
  Essentially, it as a datastore that is globally distributed across
  multiple data centers where each transaction globally consistent. Get that, it is
  globally consistent, not eventually consistent. They use several
  techniques to accomplish this but one of the most notable is that
  they use specialized hardware that includes atomic clocks and GPS on
  each server.
