## Show Notes

* [What is Observability?](https://honeycomb.io/observability/)
  * Monitoring, Metrics, Log aggregation
  * Focus your energy on instrumentation, resilience to failure, and making it fast and safe to deploy and roll back
  * gather absolutely as much context as possible
  * Instrumentation is just as important as unit tests.
    * Does this mean we need to reconsider the way applications are built?  Do we need to start constructing observable applications?  How?
* [`o11y`?](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/908493669518290944?lang=en)
* What products, or sorts of products, are gaining traction in observability?
* What are the trends and who are the people to follow?
* What blogs, papers, books should be on my Observability reading list?
