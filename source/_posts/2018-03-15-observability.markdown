## Show Notes

* [What is Observability?](https://honeycomb.io/observability/)
  * Monitoring, Metrics, Log Aggregation
  * Focus your energy on instrumentation, resilience to failure, and making it fast and safe to deploy and roll back.
  * Gather absolutely as much context as possible.
  * Instrumentation is just as important as unit tests.
    * Does this mean we need to reconsider the way applications are built?  Do we need to start constructing observable applications? How?
