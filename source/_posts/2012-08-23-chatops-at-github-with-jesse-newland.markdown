-----------

 * [Jamie  Winsor](http://vialstudios.com) has started a guide on [how to author
  a cookbook the berkshelf way](http://vialstudios.com/guide-authoring-cookbooks.html). It is still a work in progress but it is a great primer on the Riot Games' way of cookbook development. Of special note is the `berks cookbook`
  command which can be used in place of `knife cookbook create`. It
  will generate a Vagrantfile, .gitignore, Gemfile, and even a
  Thorfile with a foodcritic task.  
 
* [Jamie  Winsor](http://vialstudios.com) has released version 0.0.2
  of [ridley](https://github.com/reset/ridley) a reliable Chef API
  client with a simple intuitive DSL. Also, it is threadsafe and
  supports multiple connections per thread. Lastly it works with
  Hosted Chef, Open Source Chef, and private Chef.

* [Archlinux may be switching](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4383243) its default
  init system from the Old Skool sysv init system to
  [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/).   

* Yosefk had a great blog post [What "Worse is Better vs The
  Right Thing" is really about](http://www.yosefk.com/blog/what-worse-is-better-vs-the-right-thing-is-really-about.html).
  tl;dr an evolved system will beat the best designed system. The
  article has a great quote from linus
 <blockquote>Don't underestimate the power of survival of the fittest. And don't
  ever make the mistake that you can design something better than what
  you get from ruthless massively parallel trial-and-error process with a
  feedback cycle. Thatâ€™s giving your intelligence much too much
  credit.
</blockquote>
  We just mentioned Ridley, a Chef API client. A good Chef API already
  exists in Dan Ryan's spice. We also talked about berkshelf which
  competes with librarian-chef. This competition is not a bad thing,
  it is an awesome thing. It this competition that drives software
  quality in the open-source world.
  This post also made me think about the keynote that Adam Jacob gave at
  Chefconf where he essentially said that he wanted to give sysadmins
  better primitives, not prescribe to them how to configure their
  systems.

* Dan Ryan has released
  [Rorschach](https://github.com/danryan/rorschach) a simple alerting
  tool that uses Graphite for event data.

 * [Obfuscurity](https://twitter.com/#!/obfuscurity) has put a great
  screencast up on [how to install
  graphite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-g--_Be2jc) even if you
  use a chef cookbook to set up your graphite installation I highly
  recommend watching this screencast to get a better sense of how all
  the pieces work together. Obfuscurity would like to know if there is
  interest in further screencasts on graphite. If you like this one,
  let him know! I vote for a screencast on how to use Composer.

* The open-sourcing of erChef has begun! There are bunch of erChef
  repos now in [https://github.com/opscode](https://github.com/opscode), just to name a few
  [chef_objects](https://github.com/opscode/chef_objects), [chef_db](https://github.com/opscode/chef_db), [chef_index](https://github.com/opscode/chef_index), and more on the way!

 * We've hinted at this project before but now it's finally out.
  [Test-kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen) is a
  framework for running project integration tests in an isolated
  environment using Vagrant and Chef.

* Test-kitchen relies on baseboxes created by the
  [bento](https://github.com/opscode/bento) project, which is a set of
  modularized veewee definitions. As a direct result of bento, Opscode
  has made a set of vagrant boxes publicly available, each containing
  the omnibus version of chef and ruby 1.9. If you work on public cookbooks and
  you do testing with vagrant, I highly recommend you use these boxes.
  Your collaborators will thank you.

 * [Seth Vargo](https://twitter.com/sethvargo) released version 0.1.0
  of [strainer](https://github.com/customink/strainer) which enables
  the loading  of cookbook dependencies and better PATH support.

* After months of planning + over 7000 lines changed: Vagrant core is
  no longer tied to VirtualBox.
  [mitchellh](https://twitter.com/mitchellh) merged the
  machine-abstraction branch into vagrant master that abstracts all
  the virtualbox-specific code into a plugin. This means you can now
  add support for an additional virtualization platform through a
  plugin. btw, we will have [mitchellh](https://twitter.com/mitchellh) and [pdebois](http://twitter.com/pdebois) on the show in early
  September to talk about the future of Vagrant!
  
## Upcoming Meetup Groups

* [Chef-BOSTON](http://www.meetup.com/Chef-BOSTON/) will be meeting on 
  Tuesday, August 28 to talk about [Team Development Workflows with Chef](www.meetup.com/Chef-BOSTON/events/76035282/)
* [The Bay Area Chef User Group](http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Chef-User-Group)
  will host another Chef Cafe on Thursday, September 6
* [devopsdays Rome](http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-italy/)
  are coming up on October 5 and 6th. If you are in Europe or otherwise
  interested to meet with some really intelligent people, you should
  come out. The attendance fee is trivial and Bryan's wife has agreed that
  you can all stay in his spare bedroom. all of you ;).

Outline<a name="outline"></a>
------

* journey to infrastructure as code
* shadow puppet & moon shine
* puppet DSL
* puppet lint & puppet rspec
* physical vs virtual
* github has around ~150 physical servers
* Several dozen cloud instances
* all physical servers managed in rackspace so they don't actually ever deal with the hardware
* Pacemaker, awesome HA tool that is also a PITA
* chef dominodes, knife-github chef tools written by Jesse
* day in the life
  * check issues
  * review pull requests
  * ask hubot about nagios
* Hubot
* Jesse spends a lot of time on File system management for all the repos
* Smoke for routing / rpc
* bert and ernie, erlang rpc tools
* coffeescript
* language vs. pre-processors (like coffescript)
* ruby for sysadmins -- Jesse agrees
* Jesse's educational background - comp sci then business
* speeding up I/O
  * 600GB 15K RPM SATA drives
  * stock debian
  * so, not much in terms of optimization
* continuous deploy
  * master build passes, gets pushed out
  * sometimes to a small number of servers
  * sometimes will deploy a branch first to verify / validate then merge into master
* mcollective - it's there but they don't really use it
* Puppet runs every hour and on-demand
* What's special about github?  They're pushing everything to chat.  ChatOps.  Communication is the default since everything is done via Hubot in a campfire room.  side benefit:  free training
