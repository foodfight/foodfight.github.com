We held two different Hangouts on Google+ this week.  Thank you to everyone who participated!

What did you think about the format, topics, time of day, etc. of the Hangouts?  We'd want to hear your feedback!  Should we keep doing these?  Drop us a line at [info@foodfightshow.org](mailto:info@foodfightshow.org).
