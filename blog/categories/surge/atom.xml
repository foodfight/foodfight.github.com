<p>In this DevOps Delicacy, Nathen sits down with <a href="http://twitter.com/lapsu">Matt Grahamn</a> from Etsy.  They discussed Matt's Surge presentation:</p>

<h4><a href="http://omniti.com/surge/2012/sessions/changing-etsys-architectural-foundation-with-continuous-deployment">Changing Etsy's Architectural Foundation with Continuous Deployment</a></h4>

<p>You hate that crusty old hunk of company technology that has long outlived the reasons it was adopted in the first place. But after all this time, it's stuck in the middle of everything; how to get rid of it?</p>

<p>At Etsy, we have successfully replaced our biggest problems with the small fixes of Continuous Deployment. How did deployment arrive at the state it is in today from the primitive practices of the 1980s? What practices and tools make it possible to deploy production code more than 50 times per day?</p>

<p>How does such frequent change actually improve quality and agility? Where can Continuous Deployment be applied? Finally, see how Continuous Deployment brings changes to an architectural foundation from a state of impossibility to the realm of safety and feasibility.</p>

<p>In this DevOps Delicacy, Nathen sits down with Mike Nolet, CTO &amp; Co-founder of AppNexus.  They discussed Mike's Surge presentation:</p>

<h4><a href="http://omniti.com/surge/2012/sessions/from-zero-to-500k-qps-in-three-years-scaling-appnexus">From Zero to 500k QPS in Three Years: Scaling AppNexus</a></h4>

<p>I'd like to tell our story of how we went from two guys on a couch who thought they could build a cloud-hosting company, to more than 200 employees, building the world leader in real-time advertising technology. This presentation will give an uncensored dive into both our colossal mistakes as well as our tremendous successes. How, over the course of one weekend, we used GSLB and KeepAlive to hack our servers into place, build a backend to support them, and freed ourselves from the grips of expensive LB vendors. How, because weâ€™ve always invested in full-time resources for our fully automated deployment world, we managed to not hire a single test engineer until March 2012. How a stupid mistake took down 3/4 of our global data centers for 12 hours and how we still managed to maintain 99.5% uptime.</p>

<p>I'll explore our devops infrastructure, powered by our in-house built continuous deployment system; our load-balancing infrastructure and its many layers; and our real-time and data streaming infrastructure, built primarily in C and processing 12 terabytes of data every day.</p>

<p>This is our story of scaling from zero to 500,000 queries per second in three years.</p>

<p>In this DevOps Delicacy, Nathen sat down with <a href="https://twitter.com/achompas">Alejandro Companioni</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/davezwieback">Dave Zwieback</a> from <a href="http://www.knewton.com/">Knewton</a>.</p>

<p>They discussed Alejandro's Surge presentation and Dave's lightning talk.</p>

<h3><a href="http://omniti.com/surge/2012/sessions/autoscaling-with-leptoid-using-time-series-analysis-and-application-metrics-to-scale-the-knewton-platform">Autoscaling With Leptoid: Using Time Series Analysis and Application Metrics To Scale the Knewton Platform</a></h3>

<p>Auto-scaling is the holy grail of cloud computing. While the mechanics of auto-scaling are fairly straightforward, it can be difficult to find a reliable signal for determining the exact amount of computing resources required at any given moment. Could we analyze the strong periodic and seasonal behavior (like students finishing homework at night or cramming before finals) of the hundreds of thousands of students who study on the Knewton platform and surface a strong signal? Did we identify a correlation between system metrics (e.g., CPU or memory utilization) and application performance? Did continuous deployment practices at Knewton continuously change the performance characteristics of applications? In this presentation, I'll discuss our experience analyzing these different metrics, and identifying potential features for a statistical model that can predict load changes, allowing Knewton to automatically scale our cloud-based infrastructure.</p>
