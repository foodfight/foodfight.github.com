<h4><a href="http://omniti.com/surge/2012/sessions/big-data-without-big-database-extreme-in-memory-caching">Big Data Without Big Database—Extreme In-Memory Caching</a></h4>

<p>These days it is not uncommon to have 100s of gigabytes of data that must be sliced and diced, then delivered fast and rendered quickly. Typically solutions involve lots of caching and expensive hardware with lots of memory. And, while those solutions certainly can work, they aren't always cost effective, or feasible in certain environments (like in the cloud). This talk seeks to cover some strategies for caching large data sets without tons of expensive hardware, but through software and data design.</p>

<p>It's common wisdom that serving your data from memory dramatically improves application performance and is a key to scaling. However, caching large datasets brings its own challenges: distribution, consistency, dealing with memory limits, and optimizing data loading just to name a few. This talk will go through some of the challenges, and solutions, to achieve fast data queries in the cloud. The audience will come away armed with a number of practical techniques for organizing and building caches for non-transactional datasets that can be applied to scale existing systems, or design new systems.</p>

<h4><a href="http://omniti.com/surge/2012/sessions/changing-etsys-architectural-foundation-with-continuous-deployment">Changing Etsy's Architectural Foundation with Continuous Deployment</a></h4>

<p>You hate that crusty old hunk of company technology that has long outlived the reasons it was adopted in the first place. But after all this time, it's stuck in the middle of everything; how to get rid of it?</p>

<p>At Etsy, we have successfully replaced our biggest problems with the small fixes of Continuous Deployment. How did deployment arrive at the state it is in today from the primitive practices of the 1980s? What practices and tools make it possible to deploy production code more than 50 times per day?</p>

<p>How does such frequent change actually improve quality and agility? Where can Continuous Deployment be applied? Finally, see how Continuous Deployment brings changes to an architectural foundation from a state of impossibility to the realm of safety and feasibility.</p>

<h4><a href="http://omniti.com/surge/2012/sessions/from-zero-to-500k-qps-in-three-years-scaling-appnexus">From Zero to 500k QPS in Three Years: Scaling AppNexus</a></h4>

<p>I'd like to tell our story of how we went from two guys on a couch who thought they could build a cloud-hosting company, to more than 200 employees, building the world leader in real-time advertising technology. This presentation will give an uncensored dive into both our colossal mistakes as well as our tremendous successes. How, over the course of one weekend, we used GSLB and KeepAlive to hack our servers into place, build a backend to support them, and freed ourselves from the grips of expensive LB vendors. How, because we’ve always invested in full-time resources for our fully automated deployment world, we managed to not hire a single test engineer until March 2012. How a stupid mistake took down 3/4 of our global data centers for 12 hours and how we still managed to maintain 99.5% uptime.</p>

<p>I'll explore our devops infrastructure, powered by our in-house built continuous deployment system; our load-balancing infrastructure and its many layers; and our real-time and data streaming infrastructure, built primarily in C and processing 12 terabytes of data every day.</p>

<p>This is our story of scaling from zero to 500,000 queries per second in three years.</p>
