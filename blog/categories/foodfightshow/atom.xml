    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Looking Back</h2>

<p>Thank you for your support of the podcast this year!  We released 57
episodes and have seen about 40,000 downloads.  That's about 700 downloads
for each episode.  We hosted 4 Google+ Hangouts which have about 900
views.  We've enjoyed the Hangouts so much that we decided to use a Google+
Hangout, instead of Skype, to facilitate our <a href="http://foodfightshow.org/2012/12/ops-school-and-training-sysadmins.html">last episode of the year</a>.
This episode was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpbr8F2RGBs">streamed live to YouTube</a>
and released as an audio podacast.</p>

<h2>Listener Survey</h2>

<p>We recently opened up a <a href="http://bit.ly/ffssurvey">listener poll</a> to gather
some feedback from you on how we can make the show even more awesome in
2013.</p>

<p>A quick summary of the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/foodfightshow/Survey+Results.pdf">survey results is now available</a>.
Thanks to everyone who participated.</p>

<h2>Changes for 2013</h2>

<p>As we look forward to 2013, there are a couple of things that we're going
to change:</p>

<ol>
<li>Whenever feasible, episodes will now be recorded via Google+ Hangout
with a live stream posted to YouTube.</li>
<li>We will try to keep the show length to about one hour.</li>
<li>We will start a regular Food Fight Show newsletter which will include
the content from the What's Cookin' section and any other noteworthy items.
More details about how to subscribe will be made available soon.</li>
</ol>


<p>The <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/foodfightshow/Survey+Results.pdf">listener survey</a>
gave us some ideas about what sort of topics you'd like to see covered on
the show.  We'll work to line-up those topics and would really appreciate
your help in doing so.  Is there someone you really want to hear from?  A
topic you'd really like to see covered?  Please let us know!</p>

<h2>Thank You!</h2>

<p>We really appreciate all of the time you've put in listening to the show in
2012.  We hope to see you at <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com">#ChefConf 2013</a>
and other conferences throughout the year.</p>

<p>We'd also like to thank <a href="http://www.opscode.com">Opscode</a> for their
continued support of the show.  They cover our hosting and bandwidth costs
and allow their employees to participate on the show on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Keep it hot!<br/>
